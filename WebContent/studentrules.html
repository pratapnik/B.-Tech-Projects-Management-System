   					<h4>Registration:</h4><p> The Academic Section coordinates the BTP registration
						activity between the BTP supervisor and the students. Faculty members
						float a number of BTP topics and they assign BTPs projects to students
						after duly assessing the studentsâ€™ interest in the area of the project. A
						faculty member normally must not take more than 15 students for BTP
						supervision. Any exceptions to the optimum number can only be relaxed
						by AC-AAC based on the merit of the case and paucity of faculty in a
						given area. AC-defined upper limit, if any, should normally be followed.</p><br><br>
						
					<h4>BTP Evaluation:</h4><p> For each BTP Team, there will be ONE Evaluation
						Committee.<br> Supervisor(s) shall be the convener of the committee.
						HoD of the Principal Supervisor will appoint TWO members of the
						committee (who are familiar with the field of study of BTP) from his
						department or may require help from another department depending upon
						the area of expertise required for a fair evaluation.<br>
						(a) Supervisor may suggest three or more names from his / her department
						and (optionally) two or more from outside his / her department based on
						the area of the BTP work;<br>
						(b) The HoD shall then select any two from the departmental list and
						(optionally) anyone from outside the departmental list, depending upon the
						nature of the project;<br>
						HoD of the Principal Supervisor may, optionally, appoint ONE additional
						member from any other department;<br>
						The same Evaluation Committee can evaluate more than one BTP team of
						the same Supervisor (if the field of study remains the same); the supervisor
						should submit a print-out of the plagiarism check (LNMIIT has license of
						Turnitin software for similarity checking) of the BTP Project Report /
						Thesis;<br>
						Each Committee submits marks for each student separately (out of 100).<br>
						The grading will be done by the committee for each student separately.</p>
